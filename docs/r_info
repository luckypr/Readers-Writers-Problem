	Reader Program

*******************************************************

How Reader works?

	- Reader will listen for Ctrl+C signal(SIGINT) and when received it will kill W1 and W2
	- Send SIGCONT to W2
	- Attach to shared memory region
	- Open semaphore
	- On every 2 seconds count number of characters in bufer
	- On every 10 seconds display stats(histogram)

What is histogram?

	- It is history of character occurrences in bufer
	- It will display for every character how many times it was generated and writen to bufer

Symbols in histogram:

	- Symbol * will show how many hundreds
	- Symbol + will show how many tens
	- And symbol - will show how many ones

Example:

	A-012 +--
	B-132 *+++--
	.
	.
	.
	T-075 +++++++-----
	
Destroying shared memory segment and named semaphore:

	- When reader proram receive signal SIGINT it will destroy shared memory segment and named semaphore
	- Use ipcs -m for listing all shared memory regions in system
	- Use ls -al /dev/shm/ to list all named semaphores
