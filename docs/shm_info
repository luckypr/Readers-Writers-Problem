		How Shared Memory Segment works

******************************************************************


- It is a C structure that has:

	- roff		-> that is read offset(where to start reading)
	- woff		-> that is write offset(where to start writing)
	- buf		-> bufer size of 256 bytes


- By using binary semaphore we will prevent multiple process of writing in bufer at same time
